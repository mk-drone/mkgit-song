            Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move,
            gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.
            Oh, oh, child, when you shake that thing
            gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.
            Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way,
            watch your honey drip, I can't keep away.            
            <br/>            
            <br/>
            Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah.
            Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah.
            <br/>
            I gotta roll, can't stand still,
            got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
            Eyes that shine burning red,
            dreams of you all through my head.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
            <br/>
            Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby,
            Tell me would you do me now.
            Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby,
            Move me while you groove me now
            <br/>
            Didn't take too long 'fore I found out,
            what people mean by down and out.
            Spent my money, took my car,
            started telling her friends she gonna be a star.
            I don't know but I been told,
            a big-legged woman ain't got no soul.
