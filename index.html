            Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move,
            gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.
            Oh, oh, child, when you shake that thing
            gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.
            Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way,
            watch your honey drip, I can't keep away.            
            <br\>            
            <br\>
            Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah.
            Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah.

            I gotta roll, can't stand still,
            got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
            Eyes that shine burning red,
            dreams of you all through my head.
